## ðŸ“˜ Project Background

Walmart is one of the largest retail chains in the world, operating thousands of stores across various regions, offering everything from groceries to electronics.

We have weekly sales data available for various Walmart outlets. We will use statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and trends that provide stakeholders with a clear view of business performance. We are also tasked with forecasting sales for the next 12 weeks to support data-driven decision-making.
